# Zotero
Scripts for helping in collaborative Systematic Review

## Activate Debug
I was not able to print on the console (see below). 
Alternative: Activate the debug in Preferences > Advanced > Configure Editor 

Search for:
`extensions.zotero.debug.log` and set it to `true`

Now Open the Debug console:
Help > Debug Output logging

## Open The Run Development console
Go to Tools > Developer > Run Javascript

Here you can run the scripts, the output will be in the debug console
